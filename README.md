This repository contains a collection of foundational C programming projects completed as part of the **Holberton School / Tuwaiq Academy Software Engineering Program**. Each project demonstrates key concepts in low-level programming, systems development, and the C language.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

The aim of this repository is to build deep understanding and practical skills in:

- Procedural programming using C
- System-level development concepts
- Manual memory management
- Pointers, arrays, recursion, and data structures
- File handling via system calls
- Code clarity, style, and debugging

## 📂 Project Structure

Each directory focuses on a specific concept or skill:

| Folder Name                  | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `hello_world`               | First steps with C, compilation, and output |
| `variables_if_else_while`   | Control structures and flow (loops, conditionals) |
| `functions_nested_loops`    | Creating and using functions with nested logic |
| `more_functions_nested_loops` | Deeper loop practice, logic building |
| `pointers_arrays_strings`   | Working with memory directly: pointers, arrays, strings |
| `malloc_free`               | Basics of dynamic memory allocation |
| `more_malloc_free`          | More advanced use of `malloc`, `free`, and memory safety |
| `recursion`                 | Solving problems using recursive techniques |
| `argc_argv`                 | Handling command-line arguments in `main()` |
| `bit_manipulation`          | Low-level operations using binary and bitwise logic |
| `file_io`                   | Reading and writing files using system calls |
| `function_pointers`         | Passing functions as arguments and callbacks |
| `variadic_functions`        | Using `va_list` to handle variable argument functions |
| `structures_typedef`        | Creating and using `structs`, plus clean typedef usage |
| `singly_linked_lists`       | Implementation of singly linked list operations |
| `doubly_linked_lists`       | Creation and manipulation of doubly linked lists |
